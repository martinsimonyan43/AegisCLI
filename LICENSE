GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
--------

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the
community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change free software—and to make sure the software is
free for all its users. This License is intended to guarantee your freedom to:

- distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),
- receive source code or obtain it if you want it,
- modify the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
- know you can do these things.

Developers who use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:  
(1) assert copyright on the software, and  
(2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute,
and/or modify it.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in
alternate versions become available for other developers.

But for software used on servers, cooperation can break down: someone can modify
the software, run it publicly on a server, and refuse to release the modified
source. The GNU AGPL fixes this by requiring that users interacting with the
software over a network must be able to receive the source code of that modified
version.

Terms and Conditions
--------------------

### 0. Definitions

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws.

“The Program” refers to any program or work licensed under this License.

“A covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on it.

“To modify” means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work.

“Propagate” means anything that would require permission under applicable
copyright, except executing or modifying privately.

“To convey” means any kind of propagation that enables others to make or receive
copies.

An interactive user interface must display “Appropriate Legal Notices,” meaning
a notice stating the copyright and license notices, and telling the user how to
view the license.

### 1. Source Code

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form for making modifications.

### 2. Basic Permissions

You may copy and distribute the Program verbatim. You may charge any price or
none. Modifying the program requires following the rest of the license.

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

No covered work shall be considered part of an effective technological measure
under laws that restrict circumvention.

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program. You must include appropriate
copyright notices and disclaimers.

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey a modified version if you:

- keep the license the same,
- state changes clearly,
- license the whole work under this License,
- include all necessary notices.

### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey non-source forms (compiled binaries) under conditions ensuring
corresponding source is available.

### 7. Additional Terms

Additional permissions may supplement this License. Additional requirements must
also comply.

### 8. Termination

You lose rights under this License if you violate it, but rights can be restored
if the violation stops.

### 9. Acceptance Not Required

You don't have to accept this License just to run the Program.

### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each recipient gets a license from the original licensors, with no new
restrictions.

### 11. Patents

Contributors grant a patent license for their contributions.

### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

You may not impose further restrictions on recipients' exercise of rights.

### 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU AGPL

If the Program is used to interact with users through a network, the complete
corresponding source must be offered to those users.

### 14. Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised versions. You may choose any
later version unless the Program specifies otherwise.
